# Multi-gene phylogenetic reconstruction using MAFFT, IQ-TREE, and ape

This repository documents a short, reproducible pipeline for reconstructing a phylogeny from multiple genes using Linux-based tools, including MAFFT for sequence alignment and IQ-TREE for maximum-likelihood inference, followed by tree rooting and visualization in R using the ape package. All steps are performed on the Virginia Tech Advanced Research Computing (ARC) system.
