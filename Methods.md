# Methods

Sequence data from 31 specimens of wild and domestic cats (Carnivora: Felidae: Felinae) were obtained from NCBI. Three gene regions were used for phylogenetic inference: CO1, CytB, and ND1. Each gene was stored in a separate FASTA file and concatenated prior to alignment. For each gene, sequences were aligned independently using MAFFT v7. Alignments were inspected to confirm that sequence lengths and taxon representation were consistent.

Partition information corresponding to individual genes was generated ina a nexus file to allow gene-specific selection during phylogenetic inference. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the maximum likelihood-based phylogenetics software IQ-TREE 2. The unrooted phylogen. Branch support was assessed using bootstrap resampling, and bootstrap values were mapped onto the inferred topology. Resulting trees were visualized and formatted in R using the ape package, with trees ladderized for clarity and bootstrap values displayed only for nodes exceeding a specified support threshold.
