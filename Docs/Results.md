## Phylogenetic relationships within the sampled taxa of Felinae

Maximum likelihood analysis of the analyzed genes recovered a well-resolved phylogeny of Felinae with strong overall nodal support. Bootstrap values were high across the tree, with the majority of internal nodes receiving ≥80% support; only four nodes fell below this threshold.

Most sampled felid genera were recovered as monophyletic, including *Acynonyx*, *Caracal*, *Catopuma*, *Felis*, and *Leopardus*. *Herpailurus* was recovered as paraphyletic. Relationships among the major feline lineages were largely consistent with established phylogenetic hypotheses.

At the species level, most taxa formed well-supported monophyletic clades. However, two species were recovered as paraphyletic: *Felis catus* and *Leopardus tigrinus*. One individual of *Felis lybica* was nested within the *Felis catus* branch with very short distances, while all samples of *Leopardus pardalis* were nested within the *L. tigrinus* branch on longer but better supported branches.

## Outgroup placement and rooting
The phylogeny was rooted using the White-bellied pangolin (*Manis tricuspis*), which was recovered as the most distantly related taxon, consistent with its placement outside Carnivora. Within Carnivora, felids were recovered as more closely related to hyaenids and viverrids, and to a lesser extent nandiniids than to caniform carnivorans, with *Canis lupus* branching more basally relative to the feliform clade. These relationships were supported by high bootstrap values and are consistent with higher-level carnivoran phylogeny.
